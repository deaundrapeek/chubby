We are going to build a traffic light.

## Directions

After you open this lab in Nitrous, You'll want to open `index.html` in both the browser and the Nitrous text editor. 

In terminal type: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`. Go to the Preview at the top of Nitrous and click on `Port 3000 (Default)`. Play around with the buttons and see what they do.



You'll be coding your solution in `script.js`. Open up the file `script.js` file. Fill in code in each of the following sections:
  ```
  - code for button 3 -- Turn the light Yellow 
  - code for button 4 -- Turn the light Green
  - code for button 5 -- Say GO!
  - code for button 6 -- Make Green Light Blink -- Extension!!
  ```

Save your changes to `script.js`. Refresh the page in the browser to see your changes!
